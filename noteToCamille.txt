During class Mr. Zamansky told me about this thing called a dialog box.
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/components/dialog.html
It's basically like a pop-up window, but it's useful in our case 'cause once the user opens one you can force them to focus only on that window. Meaning that you can't like work on Room.java while you have keypad or scramble open. I tryed it out in scramble and it works pretty well. This solves the problem of being able to tell when the user has won.
I think we should use it in all our classes which have separate windows.
Here's a broad example of how to use it: http://www.java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0240__Swing/ASimpleModalDialog.htm
and you can look at scramble to see what I did.
Basically for us, in each class we use it we need to:
1. extend JDialog
2. change the constructor to CLASSNAME(JFrame parent,boolean modal){}
3. include the line 'super(parent, true);' in the constructor
In Room.java when you instantiate just put CLASSNAME(this, true);
'true' makes sure the file is modal
 and modality defines whether the focus should be on one window only or not
